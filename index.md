    Lab 11 was my favortie lab. I enjoyed learning about the code that generates random numbers. I felt like we were putting together a lot of the work we had done from the previous labs. Learning the code for dealing with object oriented classes was difficult. I felt like this was the lab where I learned the most.

 Lab 1 was an entertaining Lab. A lot of our class struggled to log into the computers, and I didn't actually get started until about and hour into the lab. The contents of the Lab were pretty basic, but I had no prior computer science experience before that, so it took me a while to figure out what was going on. This lab gave me a better understanding of what this class was about.

  Lab 12 was an interesting lab. We covered a lot of unfamiliar material. In the end we were able to make an animated image. It was definitely the coolest final result out of any of the Labs we did. It was also nice having a lot of the code already done for us. Science Projects
